      <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
      <p>Historical events continue to shape our present and future. And there is
        very famous quote that says "History repeats itself". So we should study
        about history. Like the way US did after WW2. What was the reason no big
        war came in after WW2. They studied at the first place why ww2 happened coz
        of the poor economy of Germany and people starving for food. So they give money
        and market for german manufecturers and we can see the prosperity in Germany and
        no big war came after that. </p>
